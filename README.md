Depression and anxiety are common psychiatric disorders, and lifetime occurrence rates are two times higher in women than men. 
One factor that could contribute to this phenomenon is exposure to interpersonal violence (IPV), which women are at a higher risk for. Survivors of IPV have a greater chance of developing mental illness following exposure. 
The purpose of this study is to examine phenotypic associations between symptoms of depression, anxiety, and IPV, and if these associations vary between men and women in a college-age sample. 
Data were from the Spit for Science project collected from college students (N = 7,732, 62% female). Participants' depression and anxiety symptom scores were calculated based on an abbreviated Symptoms Checklist-90 (SCL-90). 
IPV exposure was determined via self-report if the participant had ever experienced physical assault, sexual assault, or other uncomfortable sexual experiences. 
Mean depression and anxiety symptom scores were significantly higher in women than men (depression: 9.15 female,  8.04 male, t=13.03, p<2.2 x 10<sup>-16</sup>; anxiety: 7.12 female, 6.21 male, t=13.07, p<2.2 x 10<sup>-16</sup>). 
Female participants also had higher rates of exposure to IPV than males (39% vs. 33%). 
These results are in agreement with previous studies that have identified a greater risk for IPV exposure in college-aged women compared to men. 
Further analyses aim to determine if exposure to IPV is correlated with depression and anxiety symptoms and if these associations vary by sex.
